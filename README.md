# Push/Leg/Pull Split; 
Great for when you can workout 5-6 times a week and have relatively low day-to-day stress. Highly intensive and effective.

	- When you do not have enough time to workout 5-6 times a week, change to a full body split 3 times a week; 
	This way you can make progress since you are still frequently targeting each movemnet and body part (3 times) each week while 
    not getting you burnt out through too much stress from working out 5-6 times a week. It is not as effective but will still maintain and
	generate gains in the long term.
	
	- Working out 3x a week - full body split - hits each movement and body part approximately *3 times a week*
	- Working out 3x a week - push/legs/pull - hits each movement and body part approximately *1 time a week*

 - When switching over to a full-body program use one that has a general structure similar to the sample full-body workouts [here](path-to-full-body-workouts).

 - Most exercise sets, reps, and weight are purposefully left blank to allow for alteration due to personal preference, fitness level, and goals.

## Push:
- Bench  - 4x3, 2x5-8 (back off sets, lighter weight but still challenging)
- Close grip bench OR decline elevated pushups
- DB rows (posted or unposted)
- Dips 
- Lateral raises - 1x15, 1x30 (second set lighter)
- Bicep curls
- Tricep extensions
- Leg raises or hanging leg raises: 2 sets till failure
- Cardio: Treadmill 1x10min

## Legs:
- Squat - 4x3, 2xamrap (back off sets, lighter weight but still challenging)
- Heavy Kettlebell swings
- DB lunges
- Leg extensions
- Leg curls
- Isometric: Horse stance 2xmax
- Leg raises or hanging leg raises: 2 sets till failure
- Cardio: Stationary bike 1x10min

## Pull:
- Deadlift - 4x3, 2xamrap (back off sets, lighter weight but still challenging)
- Pull-ups - 30 reps over multiple sets; add weight when can finish 30 reps in 5 sets or less 
- Decline elevated pushups - 2 sets 
- BB rows        
- Pendley rows   
- DB lateral raises && DB Shrugs
	* Superset - 3x15 (for raises), 3x20 (10 slow, 10 fast; for shrugs) 		
- Bicep curls    - 3-4x12
- Isometric: Pullup bar dead hangs 2xmax
- Leg raises or hanging leg raises: 2 sets till failure
- Cardio: Treadmill 1x10min

## Boxing:
- 3xmax jump rope OR boxer's skip
- 3x1 min head movement drills
- 10x2-3 min rounds shadow boxing or heavy bag
- Ab circuits or treadmill (optional)

* Always have back-off sets after doing heavy lifts, back-off sets should be lighter but still be in the effective weight range.
	- Ex. If the heavy sets are: `4x3 Bench 235lbs @RPE9-10`, then the back off sets should be: `2x5 195lbs @RPE7-8`; and not 2x5 135lbs @RPE3-4, since that weight is too light for any meaningful adaptions in strength or hypertrophy to occur.
