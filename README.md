# Push/Leg/Pull Split; 
Great for when you can workout 5-6 times a week and have relatively low day-to-day stress. Highly intensive and effective.

- When you do not have enough time to workout 5-6 times a week, change to a full body split 3 times a week; 
	This way you can make progress since you are still frequently targeting each movemnet and body part (3 times) each week while 
    not getting burnt out through too much stress from working out 5-6 times a week. It is not as effective but will still maintain and
	generate gains in the long term.
	
	- Working out 3x a week - full body split - hits each movement and body part approximately *3 times a week*
	- Working out 3x a week - push/legs/pull - hits each movement and body part approximately *1 time a week*

 - When switching over to a full-body program use one that has a general structure similar to the sample full-body workouts [here](https://github.com/MuhammedAbu/Workout-Sample-Routine/blob/main/README.md#full-body-workout-1).

 - Most exercise sets, reps, and weight are purposefully left blank to allow for alteration due to personal preference, fitness level, and goals.

## Legs:

## Pull:
- Deadlift - 4x3, 2x8-12 (back off sets, lighter weight but still challenging)
- Pull-ups - 30 reps over multiple sets; add weight when can finish 30 reps in 5 sets or less 
- Decline elevated pushups OR push-ups - 2 sets 
- Barbell rows        
- Pendley rows

	* Superset - 3x15 (for raises), 3x20 (10 slow, 10 fast; for shrugs)

***Always have back-off sets after doing heavy lifts, back-off sets should be lighter but still be in the effective weight range.***
- Ex. If the heavy sets are: `4x3 Bench 235lbs @RPE9-10`, then the back off sets should be: `2x5 195lbs @RPE7-8`; and not 2x5 135lbs @RPE3-4, since that weight is too light for any meaningful adaptations in strength or hypertrophy to occur.
